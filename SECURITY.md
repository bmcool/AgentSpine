## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, report them via one of the following:

* **Preferred**: Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/bmcool/AgentSpine/security/advisories/new) in this repository.
* Or email the maintainers (if contact is listed in the repo profile or README).

Include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and affected versions if possible. We will respond as soon as we can and will work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping keep AgentSpine and its users safe.
